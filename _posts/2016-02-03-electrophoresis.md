Electrophoresis

Pulling forces are equal

They don't move at all

an ion of acid, breaks down to give minus, so attracted to the positive pole

And an ion of amine, breaks down to give plus, so it more attracted to the negative pole

The r group can have acid, or have an extra amine

When ion charge is unbalanced, the current pulls it one way

Electrophoresis

The blobs gets pulled by electrodes

The blobs moves by charge attraction

They move faster when charge is higher

Their size also affects their speed of movement

The bigger they are the clunkier they go

buffer pH lower, there is more protons, amines turns plus while acids stays constant 

buffer pH higher, it is more basic, acids be minus but amines stays same
