- Music - opening, death of Syria (which was also made longer) - music initiated the sinister tone, and music built up death of Syrian, but why was it drawn out of so long?
- Addition of scene - salome initially hated prophet, reluctantly dancing by prophet, broke promise (mirroring later event)
- Stage - royals put higher up, multiple actions happening at once
- Makeups - why so brightly coloured, made to look almost alienish, royals more brightly coloured
- Hidden prophet voice - god and religion symbolism (blind faith by princess)
- How was the royals portrayed? Always acting snobbish in the background, acting all polite and such and posh, very absurd dressing
- Singer at beginning - will she feature again?
- Stage layout - seats on two sides, play all the way close to audience, actors make initial entrance though main gate

- Choreographed and music - extra added from play
- Final scene - Salome alone on stage, lighting darker to focus on kissing
- Killing prophet, what the guy believed in 
- Details to attention, people staying in character even not in focus
- Salome interpreted differently? Tone?
- The Moon
