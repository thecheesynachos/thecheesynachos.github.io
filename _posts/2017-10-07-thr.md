PM

- Social exclusion
- Depression is uncontrollable
- Racial discrimination, like birth lottery
- Some people have more friends than others - humans are social animals
- Support system gone during times people aren’t positive
- Cycle of isolation - if you can’t be positive for others, tends to not go out with people
- Imposter syndrome - society oppression

- Politics
- Complacency
- Never perfect social justice - never over celebrating minor victories (eg liberals don’t vote in 2010)
- Political movement out of touch - because these people are ones who aren’t optimistic

LO

- Only choice for minorities to uplift self
- The kids are told they will never succeed
- Idea of hope - you can surpass the factors regardless of society stopping to you
- People motivated regardless of being pushed down

- More relatable people who succeed for the others
- They told that you can also succeed

- Keep AA in the fight
- Best form of change for government

- Even if individuals don’t succeed
- Happiness from the comfort and endeavour
- Derive happiness from things you have

DPM

- Positivity good if there’s pragmatism

- Media narrative - ignore socioeconomic status
- Better to have realistic goals
- Blind optimism - relies life to fix self, ignore what could go wrong

- People didn’t criticise Obama’s politics because everyone sees him as a positive character

- Easier to teach people to be pragmatic
- People are rational - teach people to be skeptic and so better to teach everyone to be careful

- Women and minorities
- Everyone told to cheer up despite of them being vulnerable
- Takes away the difficulty from their life and choices
- Deny structural oppression
- Norms dictated by more fortunate ones
- Fight against inequality

DLO

- Better to tell yourself life will be better

- Optimism makes you more rational

- Fake it to make it
- At least hope that you can be happy

- Comfort can only exist in positivity
- No alternatives, result in destructive behaviours

- Social movement
- No other way to fight their oppression
- People won’t lose opportunities to go protests if - they don’t think they can make that change

- Change how you perceive others
- People give opportunities if they see potential

MOG

- If failure assured, blame passed to system
- TS, blame self because you weren’t positive enough
- Harm self because they’re at fault - so shouldn’t put pressure on them
- Victim of the system

- Positivism is at fault for people blaming why the poor are poor
- We internalise problems
- Rationalise and angry at the system
- Anger builds up and keeps on the fight

- Their side - their happiness is because they haven’t accessed the other happiness
- Taking away other opportunities

MOO

- Better prepared for failure if can see silver lining
- At least you tried - sympathy in endeavours

- Anger makes you irrational

- Positivity and rationality
- Less positivity - you less likely to come out and be pragmatic

- Open to new moralities
- Teach individuals to reform

- Individual perspective
- Plays more safe because can’t be positive and optimistic
- Not afraid of repression
