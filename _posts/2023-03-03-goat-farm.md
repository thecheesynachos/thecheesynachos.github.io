Hi everyone. As mentioned during the physical group meeting, a few of us are planning on visiting a goat farm in order to ~~check out our future career prospects~~ see some goats, have a mini lab outing and de-stress a bit. 

The farm is called Hay Dairies (website https://haydairies.sg) and it is in Lim Chu Kang area (north-west corner of Singapore).

We plan to visit the farm *in the morning (~9am, so we can also see goat milking) either on Saturday 11th March or Sunday 12th March* (weekend before the ICML rebuttals). We will probably go there using public transport (which will likely involve taking the 975 bus at some point).

If you are interested in going, please fill your name here before tomorrow: [REDACTED]. This is so that we know how many people are going (in case we need to do some booking in advance) and to decide which day to go on.
