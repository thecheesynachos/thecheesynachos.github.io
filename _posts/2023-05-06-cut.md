I opened my eyes

I stared out to the sky

I’ll lay

In bed



The plates in my sink

Dust layers are building

I’ll first fix

My head



The texts my friends left for me

Get up, there are lots to see

But I like

My blindfold on



Hit my foot on the table edge

Gave me bruises on my leg

Then sleep it off

Til the purple’s gone



Run the same three thoughts in my head

Okay the same three songs while in bed

Recall how

It began



Grow my hair, I won’t cut it

My old habits, no point changing it

Lost my hopes

Lost my plans



Window’s broken, not again

Glass shattered from the pane

Can the pieces 

Hurt my hands



Walk outside in the dark

Hearing bats in the park

See tides leave

The water side



If I scream out loud

Will the waves drown my sound

Will the moon

Care if I cried



I could climb out of my state of mind

Draw a smile, say it is all fine

Rewind

To better days



But a car that’s not broken

No one will try to fix them

So I build

My cave to stay



And I remain 

And I don’t change

And eventually

I’ll be picked up by the waves and go away
