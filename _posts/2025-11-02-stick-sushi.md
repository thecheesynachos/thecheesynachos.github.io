What is this stick sushi thing they sell in Melbourne?

I thought it was just one shop that does it but it turns out many Japanese stalls here serves something looking similar.

I typically see Maki rolls (?) where each rolls have already been chopped into smaller pieces. BUt what is this thing they serve here?

I'm not complaining though. I think it's a great way to eat sushi. Should be adopted everywhere if anything.
