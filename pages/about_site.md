This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. For more details on how to do this, you can check out <a href="https://pages.github.com/">the details on the GitHub website</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">this tutorial on Jekyll</a>.

The theme for this website is Academic Portfolio as seen <a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/academic-portfolio/">here</a>, and was created by <a href="https://github.com/ys1998/">Ys1998</a>. I don't know who they are, but it's very cool of you to have this theme available online. Thanks.
